## Future Directions

- Enterprise adoption: integration with legacy stacks, governance, ROI, and org/process change.
- Agent capability: long-horizon planning, tool reliability, robustness to distribution shift.
- Interaction & collaboration: multi-agent coordination, negotiation protocols, incentive alignment.
- Trust & safety: verification, fraud/scams, privacy, compliance, human-in-the-loop controls.
- Evaluation: standardized benchmarks, offline/online metrics, and end-to-end system testing.
