2. **Application & Ecosystem (Section 2)**: If the paper focuses on **cross-participant interactions**, **specific business models/scenarios**, or **overall solutions** rather than a single Agent type or Pipeline stage, add it to Section 2 under the appropriate category (Business Models, Channel Patterns, Interaction Modes & Protocols, or Vertical Domains).

3. **Foundations (Section 3)**: If the paper is primarily about **methodologies**, **frameworks**, **benchmarks**, or **surveys** rather than specific commerce applications, add it to Section 3 under the appropriate category (Formal Models & Frameworks, Multi-Agent Systems & Coordination, Benchmarks & Simulators, or Surveys & Taxonomies).
